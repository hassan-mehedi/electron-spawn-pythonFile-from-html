# electron-spawn-pythonFile-from-html

Trying out some features related to electron: 
1. You can use require('package-name') in your scripts if you set nodeIntegration:true in the webPreferences while creating windows
2. You can spawn or run python file using a package call python-shell 
3. In this code you can see I pass a number to the python script and it returns me the factorial of that number
4. You can spawn as many processes as you want
